Each of the above Python packages is needed to run this notebook. 
Notably, torch_geometric (PyTorch Geometric) should be installed with the version compatible to PyTorch (which is implied by torch). 
The custom modules (GVWAE, grid, data, etc.) are part of the projectâ€™s codebase and not installable via pip, so they are not listed here. 
The listed requirements cover all external dependencies used in the notebook.
